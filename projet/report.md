The aim of this project is to send commands to the ESP32 from an HTTP server. 
The ESP32 contains captors and actuators, for example we can turn on or off an LED light, we have a light captor and can retrieve its value on the server.
We also have a buzzer and the user can turn it on or off and it plays a song (zelda fans will particularly enjoy it :)).
The server is made using Javascript, HTML and CSS. To send the commands we use a MQTT broker to manage the different messages. 

It's a really comprehensive IoT project, taking different elements from all the assignments we had during the semester.
